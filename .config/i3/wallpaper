# --bg-center
#     Center the file on the background. If it is too small, it will be
#     surrounded by a border as specified by --image-bg.
# --bg-fill
#     Like --bg-scale, but preserves aspect ratio by zooming the image until it
#     fits. Either a horizontal or a vertical part of the image will be cut off
# --bg-max
#     Like --bg-fill, but scale the image to the maximum size that fits the
#     screen with borders on one side. The border color can be set using
#     --image-bg.
# --bg-scale
#     Fit the file into the background without repeating it, cutting off stuff
#     or using borders. But the aspect ratio is not preserved either.
# --bg-tile
#     Tile (repeat) the image in case it is too small for the screen
